# Pokemon Explorer

This project is a Pokemon Explorer App that uses the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). It fetches and displays Pokemon data, allowing the user to paginate through lists of Pokemon and view details for each one.

## Technologies

- Node.js v18
- Expo
- React Native

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the app running on your local machine:

### Prerequisites

- Make sure you have Node.js installed (v18 is recommended). You can download Node.js from the [official site](https://nodejs.org/).
- Install Expo CLI globally on your machine. Use the following command to install it:
  npm install -g expo-cli

- If you wish to run the app on a simulator/emulator, make sure to set up the iOS Simulator (for Mac) or Android Emulator (for Windows/Linux).

### Installation

1. Clone the repo on your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/frengo121/freddyDuque_pokemon_app.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd freddyDuque_pokemon_app
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the App

1. Start the Expo server:

```bash
npm start
```

This will open up a page in your default web browser with a QR code and some options.

2. Run the app on the iOS Simulator by pressing `i` in the terminal or selecting "Run on iOS simulator" in the browser page.

Please note that these instructions assume some familiarity with command line tools, Node.js, and React Native development. If you're new to these technologies, there are plenty of resources available online to get you started.
